### 10. LCD Driver
- The LCD driver facilitates interfacing and controlling an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) module with the STM32F103C8 microcontroller. It provides functions for initializing the display, writing data or commands, and managing the display output.

## Testing

### RCC Testing
- The RCC driver can be tested by configuring the system clock to various frequencies. An example code demonstrating clock switching can be found in `001_RCC_GPIO_TEST`.

### GPIO Testing
- GPIO driver testing involves setting pins to input/output mode, toggling their state, and reading input values. Use `001_RCC_GPIO_TEST.c` to validate GPIO functionality.

### NVIC Testing
- To test NVIC functionality, configure and trigger interrupts for different peripherals. `002_NVIC_SCB_TEST` demonstrates interrupt handling.

### SCB Testing
- SCB driver testing involves configuring system control settings such as resetting the system. Use `002_NVIC_SCB_TEST` to validate SCB functionalities.

### EXTI Testing
- Test the EXTI driver by configuring external interrupt lines and observing interrupt triggers. Use `003_EXTI_AFIO_TEST` for testing EXTI functionality.

### AFIO Testing
- AFIO testing includes configuring alternate function GPIO pins and verifying their functionality. Use `003_EXTI_AFIO_TEST` for testing AFIO features.

### SYSTICK Testing
- To test the SYSTICK driver, create delays and measure time intervals using the SysTick timer. `004_SYSTICK_TEST` demonstrates SysTick usage.

### General Purpose Timers (GPT) Testing including PWM
- Test the GPT driver by configuring general-purpose timers in various modes like PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) and observing their behavior. Use `005_GPT_TEST` to test timer functionalities, including PWM functions in `006_PWM_TEST`.

### Ultrasonic Driver Testing
- Utilize the Ultrasonic driver to interface with ultrasonic sensors for distance measurement. Example codes and usage guidelines can be found in the respective folder.
#### LCD Testing
- To test the LCD driver, an example code demonstrating the initialization and basic operations of the LCD module can be found in `006_LCD_TEST.c`. This includes initializing the LCD, writing text or custom characters, and performing basic display operations.
